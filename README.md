# stock-ticker

- Write an app that allows you to see the current price of a stock, create a buy or sell order, and store it in a db.
- Show the past orders in the frontend.
- No authentication or hosting
- Assume a single user of this app for past activity
- Be able to look up current prices for a given stock symbol
- If you can deliver us a github repo that'll do fine. No deployed url needed.
- Note: Snapshot data is cleared at 3:30am EST and gets populated as data is received from the exchanges. This can happen as early as 4am EST.
