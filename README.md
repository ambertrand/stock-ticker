# stock-ticker

- Write an app that allows you to see the current price of a stock, create a buy or sell order, and store it in a db.
- Show the past orders in the frontend.
- No authentication or hosting
- Assume a single user of this app for past activity
- Be able to look up current prices for a given stock symbol
- If you can deliver us a github repo that'll do fine. No deployed url needed.
